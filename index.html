<h4>0x00 :                Author</h4>

<p>Christian Kjær Laustsen (Tehnix) from Zeal</p>

<h4>0x01 :                Introduction</h4>

<p>MySSH (mssh) is used as an easy way to connect to ssh servers. In a file named "conList", we specify: <code>callname:username:password:server:port</code> and then using expect we connect to the server, after connection, the control is given back to the user (the expect interact command).</p>

<hr><h2>Setup and files</h2>

<h4>1x00 :                Setup</h4>

<p>Proposed setup is (in terminal):
<code>
    1. git clone <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:chrules/MySSH.git /usr/local/mssh<br>
    2. chmod 755 /usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp<br>
    3. echo "alias mssh=\"expect /usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp\"" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_login
</code>
The script can now be launched from terminal with mssh.</p>

<p>Use: <code>mssh -s callname:username:password:server:port1</code> to set your first connection.                                                 </p>

<h4>1x01 :                Manual Download</h4>

<p>If you manually downloaded the file, swap step 1 with this:
<code>
    1.1 mkdir /usr/local/mssh<br>
    1.2 mv /from/file/location/mssh.exp /usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp
</code>
Where <code>/from/file/location/mssh.exp</code> is where you saved the mssh.exp file</p>

<h4>1x02 :                Formatting of conList file</h4>

<p><code>
    callname1:username1:password1:server1:port1<br>
    callname2:username2:password2:server2<br>
    callname3:username3:password3:server3:port3
</code><br>
Each field is seperated by <code>:</code> and each line is seperated by <code>\n</code>.
If port is omitted, a standard of port 22 will be used.</p>

<hr><h2>Usage</h2>

<h4>2x00 :                Usage</h4>

<p>Notice that mssh edit expects the file to be at <code>/usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp</code>, and opens in vi editor (most *NIX environments have this). This can easily be changed though in the file.</p>

<p><code>
    usage: mssh [--version] [--path] &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]</code></p>

<pre><code>The most commonly used mssh commands are:
   help     Display this list of helpful content
   doc      Show documentation info (from README)
   names    Show a list of registered connections
   edit     Opens the mssh.exp file in vi (note that an alternative editor can
            be specified using: mssh edit &amp;lt;editor&amp;gt;)                           
   editcon  Opens the conList file in vi (note that an alternative editor can 
            be specified using: mssh editcon &amp;lt;editor&amp;gt;)                        

   -c &amp;lt;callname&amp;gt;                                                              
            Connect to server identified by &amp;lt;callname&amp;gt;
   -p &amp;lt;callname&amp;gt; 
            Use before -c to proxy use the ssh as a proxy                        
   -t "callname:username:password:server:port"                                
            Make a connection with given parameters, but do not store it!     
   -s "callname:username:password:server:port"                                
            Set a connection with specified args                              
   -d &amp;lt;callname&amp;gt;                                                              
              Delete the connection with &amp;lt;callname&amp;gt;                           
   -u &amp;lt;filepath&amp;gt;                                                              
            Use specified file instead of default conList                     
   -g       Same as names, prints a list of connections
   -f       Used with -g. Adds password (full) to the printed data
   -m       Connect with rmate (default port is 52698)
