In a file named \"conList\", we specify: `callname:username:password:server:port` and then using expect we connect to the server, after connection, the control is given back to the user (the expect interact command).\r\n\r\n####0x02 :                 License\r\n<code>\r\n    Copyright (c) 2012, Christian Kjær Laustsen\r\n    All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n    Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\n    modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n        * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\r\n          notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n        * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\r\n          notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\r\n          documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n        * Neither the name of the <organization> nor the\r\n          names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products\r\n          derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\n    THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\r\n    ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\r\n    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\r\n    DISCLAIMED.
