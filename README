+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
MySSH (mssh) is used as an easy way to connect to ssh servers.                
In a file named "conList", we specify: callname:username:password:server:port 
and then using expect we connect to the server, after connection,             
the control is given back to the user (the expect interact command).

| 1x00 :                Setup                                                |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Proposed setup is (in terminal):                                              
    1. git clone git@github.com:chrules/MySSH.git /usr/local/mssh             
    2. chmod 755 /usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp                                     
    3. ln -s /usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp /usr/local/bin/mssh                     
    4. vi /usr/local/mssh/conList                                             
    5. press "i" to edit in Vi                                                
    6. Enter the callname:username:password:server:port (see 1x02 if in doubt)
    7. type ":wq" to save and exit the file                                   
The script can now be launched from terminal with mssh.                       
                                                                              
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1x01 :                NOTE                                                 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
If you manually downloaded the file, swap step 1 with this:                   
1.1 mkdir /usr/local/mssh                                                     
1.2 mv /from/file/location/mssh.exp /usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp                  
Where "/from/file/location/mssh.exp" is where you saved the mssh.exp file

Each field is seperated by ":" and each line is seperated by "\n".            
If port is omitted, a standard of port 22 will be used.

| 2x00 :                Usage                                                |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Usage: mssh [options]                                                         
Options:                                                                      
mssh callname           launch ssh client for server associated with nickname   
mssh names              echo's list of servers and corresponding call names     
mssh help               currently, same as mssh names                           
mssh edit               open mssh file for edit through vi                      
                                                                              
Notice that mssh edit expects the file to be at /usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp,     
and opens in vi editor (most *NIX environments have this).                    
This can easily be changed though in the file.
