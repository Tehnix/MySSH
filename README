+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
MySSH (mssh) is used as an easy way to connect to ssh servers.                
In a file named "conList", we specify: callname:username:password:server:port 
and then using expect we connect to the server, after connection,             
the control is given back to the user (the expect interact command).

| 1x00 :                Setup                                                |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Proposed setup is (in terminal):                                              
    1. git clone git@github.com:chrules/MySSH.git /usr/local/mssh             
    2. chmod 755 /usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp                                     
    3. echo "alias mssh=\"expect /usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp\"" >> ~/.bash_login 
The script can now be launched from terminal with mssh.                       

Use: mssh -s callname:username:password:server:port1                          
To set your first connection.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
If you manually downloaded the file, swap step 1 with this:                   
1.1 mkdir /usr/local/mssh                                                     
1.2 mv /from/file/location/mssh.exp /usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp                  
Where "/from/file/location/mssh.exp" is where you saved the mssh.exp file

Each field is seperated by ":" and each line is seperated by "\n".            
If port is omitted, a standard of port 22 will be used.

The most commonly used mssh commands are:

   doc      Show documentation info (from README)                             
   names    Show a list of registered connections                             
   edit     Opens the mssh.exp file in vi (note that an alternative editor can
            be specified using: mssh edit <editor>)                           
   editcon  Opens the conList file in vi (note that an alternative editor can 
            be specified using: mssh editcon <editor>)                        
                                                                              
   -c <callname>                                                              
            Connect to server identified by <callname>                        
   -t "callname:username:password:server:port"                                
            Make a connection with given parameters, but do not store it!     
   -s "callname:username:password:server:port"                                
            Set a connection with specified args                              
   -d <callname>                                                              
              Delete the connection with <callname>                           
   -u <filepath>                                                              
            Use specified file instead of default conList                     
   -g       Same as names, prints a list of connections                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
Notice that mssh edit expects the file to be at /usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp,     
and opens in vi editor (most *NIX environments have this).                    
This can easily be changed though in the file.
