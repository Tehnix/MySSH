MySSH (mssh) is used as an easy way to connect to ssh servers.
In the file, you specify: nickname user server password
and then using expect we connect to the server, after connection, 
the control is given back to the user (using interact).

Proposed setup is (in terminal):
1. git clone git@github.com:chrules/MySSH.git /usr/local/mssh
2. chmod 755 /usr/local/mssh/mssh.tcl
3. ln /usr/local/mssh/mssh.tcl /usr/local/bin/mssh

or if manually downloaded swap step 1 with this:
mkdir /usr/local/mssh
mv /from/file/location/mssh.tcl /usr/local/mssh/mssh.tcl

and then the script can be launched from terminal with mssh.

Usage:
mssh nickname		# <-- launch ssh client for server associated with nickname
mssh names		# <-- echo's list of servers and corresponding call names
mssh help		# <-- currently, same as mssh names
mssh edit		# <-- open mssh file for edit through vi

Notice that mssh edit expects the target location to be /usr/local/mssh/mssh.tcl.
This can easily be changed though in the file.
