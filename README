MySSH (mssh) is used as an easy way to connect to ssh servers.
In a file named "conList.db", we specify: callname username password server port
and then using expect we connect to the server, after connection, 
the control is given back to the user (using interact).

Proposed setup is (in terminal):
1. git clone git@github.com:chrules/MySSH.git /usr/local/mssh
2. chmod 755 /usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp
3. ln -s /usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp /usr/local/bin/mssh
4. vi /usr/local/mssh/conList.db
5. Enter the callname username password server port 
and in that order.
	ex: Google googl 1ofm493 192.168.253.2 22 
	Meaning you access it by: mssh Google

Variables in conList.db is seperated by spaces! Also, it must be in the same
directory as the mssh.exp file.
! IMPORTANT ! Lines must end with a space

If you manually downloaded swap step 1 with this:
mkdir /usr/local/mssh
mv /from/file/location/mssh.exp /usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp

and then the script can be launched from terminal with mssh.

Usage:
mssh nickname		# <-- launch ssh client for server associated with nickname
mssh names		# <-- echo's list of servers and corresponding call names
mssh help		# <-- currently, same as mssh names
mssh edit		# <-- open mssh file for edit through vi

Notice that mssh edit expects the target location to be /usr/local/mssh/mssh.exp.
This can easily be changed though in the file.
