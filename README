MySSH (mssh) is used as an easy way to connect to ssh servers.
In the file, you specify: nickname user server password
and then using expect we connect to the server, after connection, 
the control is given back to the user (using interact).

Proposed setup is:
mv /from/file/location/mssh.tcl /usr/local/mssh/mssh.tcl
chmod 755 /usr/local/mssh/mssh.tcl
ln /usr/local/mssh/mssh.tcl /usr/local/bin/mssh

and then the script can be launched from terminal with mssh.

Usage:
mssh nickname		# <-- launch ssh client for server associated with nickname
mssh edit		# <-- open mssh file for edit through vi

Notice that mssh edit expects the target location to be /usr/local/mssh/mssh.tcl.
This can easily be changed though in the file.
